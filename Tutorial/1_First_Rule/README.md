In light of the current situation, we feel it is important to talk about CTF best practices for participating in All-Army CyberStakes. First, you should learn to recognize what a flag looks like. They will look along the lines of 'ACI{...}' (unless a problem says otherwise). Upon contact with a flag you should immediately "sanitize" it by pasting it into the problem's submission form and hitting submit. Let's practice with this one: ACI{this_is_a_flag}.

### Hints
* Please stay safe and practice good physical and cyber hygiene.

## Solution

Flag: **ACI{this_is_a_flag}**
