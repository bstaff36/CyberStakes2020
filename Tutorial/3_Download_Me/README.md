* Category: Tutorial
* Points: 3

We know, we know. We ask you to practice good cyber hygiene and now we're asking you to download random files from our site like [this](https://challenge.acictf.com/static/77a7e07ed0dad8181d24e7db73258727/flag) one. We promise none of these files contain actual malware that could harm your computer.

### Hints
* How can you look at a file with no extension?
* Command line tools like file and cat are useful (try typing file --help in a terminal for more info on what it does).
* Using Windows and don't have access to bash? We've got you covered. You may also be surprised what's available in Windows. Sometimes though Notepad is good enough...
