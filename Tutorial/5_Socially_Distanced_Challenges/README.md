Social Distancing for Challenges! After reading about how social distancing helps prevent the spread of diseases, we realized we can do the same thing with our challenges so that if you bork a database, you don't hurt other competitors in the process. We are proud to present Socially Distanced Challenges - now our hacking challenges can experience the same fun as us! Go read our [distancing guidance](https://acictf.com/distancing) to find out more (yes, yes there is a flag there).

## Solution
Open the distance guidance link and get the flag at the bottom of the page.
