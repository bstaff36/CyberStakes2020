This repo contains write-ups on the CyberStakes 4 challenges. I am trying to provide as many details and explanations as possible that way we
**ALL LEARN**.
I find it's not very useful to others just getting into CTF if I post a script that gets the solution.
In that vein, if there are any steps I missed, or a solution is not working in your environment, please let me know.
