This repo contains write-ups on the CyberStakes 4 challenges. I finished 17th in my group, which was my worst finish to date. So I am putting together a detailed walkthrough for each challenge I completed and will attempt the challenges I did not finish. As a grizzled blue-teamer, I am hoping to learn and get better at these red-team centric CTF competitions. I hope to provide enough detail in these write-ups that someone new to CTFs could understand the challenge and reproduce the results.  I find it's not very helpful if I only post a script that gets the solution. In that vein, if there are any steps I missed, or a solution is not working in your environment, please let me know.
